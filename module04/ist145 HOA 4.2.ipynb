Write a `letterFrequency()` function\n","\n","This function is a bit of a flashback to Module 3, when we were looking a ciphers. One common task we will perform when trying to break a cipher is to do a letter frequency analysis. Write a function called `letterFrequency()` that takes a string with some text, and returns a dictionary with the 26 lowercase English letters as keys, and the number of times each letter occurs in the text as values.
